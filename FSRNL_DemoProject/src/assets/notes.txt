Component - > are the core building block of React app.
They are used for reusability
1. Class Component
2. Function Components - when we create a component, the name start from Capital letter

Class component - 
syntax:
import {Component} from 'react';
clas Component extends Component
{
    render(
        return()
    }
} - > No longer used
Focus on Function Component
const title="My Home Page";

<h2> {title}</h2>

Props (property) - props are used to pass data from parent to child component

props are readonly, it means we can't change the prop value in the child component
-> props are passed as an attribure in a component

States - are used to manage data within a component
We can change the state data as per our requirement.
When there is any update in a state it automatically re-render in a dom without refreshing whole Page

useState(): this hook is used to manage function Component

import {useState} from 'react';
const [statename, handlermethod] = useState(initialValue);
